# StichHub

We bridge the physical gap between a tailor and the customers through our platform. Providing customers a choice of the tailors and the tailors with an increased reach for customers.
We're a team of enthusiasts, hoping to bring the tailor community online and introduce them to the benefits of online business.


## Project Overview
>**As a Tailor**
>>You can increase your reach to the customers out of your locality and hence increase the income you make while simultaneously creating a regular base of customers from the people who like your clothes.
>
>**As a customer**
>>Have you ever had trouble finding a good tailor? or found it inconvenient to visit the tailor stores multiple times to inquire or collect your own piece?
We at StichHub aim at reducing this hassle and making tailoring a convenient experience for not just the customer but also the tailor.

## Project Highlights
>We aim to ease the stitching business by providing the following features
> - Tailor of Choice-<br>
>  Choose from a list of experienced tailors, with whom you want to request your order.
> - 3D Configurator-<br>
>  Make changes to your wanted design while simultaneously seeing how it looks overall through a 3D model of yourself.
> - Online Measurements-<br>
>  We provide an online facility that enables users to accurately provide the measurements for the clothes.
> - AR Tech-<br>
>  Ever wondered if an ordered piece will turn out to be exactly same as it looks, with our tech you come one step closer to that. It enables you to know just how your piece is going to turn out.
